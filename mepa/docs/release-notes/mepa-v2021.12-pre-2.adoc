* VSC PHY header files moved from include to mepa/vtss/include.
* MESA PHY header files moved from mesa/include/ethernet/switch/api to mepa/vtss/include/microchip/switch/api.
* VSC PHY compile-time options:
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_1G: 1G PHYs, default included.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_10G: 10G PHYs, default excluded.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_TIMESTAMP: Timestamping, default excluded.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_MACSEC: MacSec, default excluded.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_PORT_COUNT: Port count, default 64.
** VTSS_OPT_PHY_TRACE: Trace, default included.
