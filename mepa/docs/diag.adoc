== Cable Diagnostics

Cable diagnostic suite provides extensive network cable information such as
link status, cable length, termination status and open/short fault location.

The API `mepa_cable_diag_start()` helps to start cable diagnostic
process. It signals API that cable diagnostic is running. Mode parameters
passed in this API helps in stating the mode in which it is running.

The API `mepa_cable_diag_get()` runs cable diagnostic process for one
iteration and checks the status iteratively and signals API when it is done.
The result is stored in data structure `mepa_cable_diag_result_t` which holds
the cable information.
