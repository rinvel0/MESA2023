Project
===============================================================================
The GPY211 is a Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) Ethernet Network Connection device
with one Ethernet PHY, supporting speeds of 10, 100, 1000 and 2500 Mbps.
It also supports a four-speed (10/100/1000/2500 Mbps) SGMII interface for
connecting with an external chip.

	g) Buffer Manager configuration APIs for PTP packet threshold to start
	   dequeuing after the buffered frame length reaches x bytes from SoP.

Version 2.4.1
-------------
This version is released with MACSec enhancements and PTP functions for PHY as below.
	a) Added MACSec VLAN parsing for using parsed 'Ether-Type' as match in MACSec rule.
	b) Added MACSec Secure Association (SA)'s current Sequence Number (SN) for triggering
	   Association Number (AN) change in dynamic MACSec keying.
	c) New 'Field Firmware Upgrading' feature for updating FW in flash using MDIO.
	d) Basic PTP feature.

Version 2.5.1
-------------
This version is released with SyncE, ADS, ULP, FFU enhancement/bug-fix.
	a) SyncE is fully implemented in v2.5.1. It works with firmware version 0x8747 onwards.
	b) Auto-down-speed (ADS) is fully implemented in v2.5.1. It works with firmware version 0x8747 onwards.
	c) Ultra-low-power (ULP) mode support is added. It works with firmware version 0x8747 onwards.
	d) Firmware Boot Mode Indication is added. There is no firmware version dependency.
	e) Field Firmware Upgrade (FFU) is enhanced to solve 20% failure with MDIO Clause 22 access.
	   It works with firmware version 0x8730 and 0x8747.
	f) 1588/PTP is enhanced. There is no firmware version dependency.

Version 2.6.1
-------------
This version is released with GPY24x support and PTP enhancement.
	a) Functional support for GPY115/GPY21x is extended for GPY24x.
	b) USXGMII Tx/Rx EQ configure for GPY24x.
	c) Auxiliary time stamp support.
	d) GPY115/GPY21x/GPY24x chip variant detection.

Version 2.6.1.2
---------------
This version is patched version of v2.6.1 for:
	a) LED pulse only mode is supported.
	b) Remove obsolete file from example script.
	c) Fix FFU check failure in GPY24x.

Version 2.6.1.3
---------------
This version is enhancement on top of v2.6.1.2 for:
	a) Remove non-supported options (light sensor mode and mix mode)
	   from LED API.
	b) Bug fix in PTP API to detect egress PTP packets.
	c) Support for GPY115/GPY21x C-step chips.

Version 2.7.1.1
---------------
This version is enhancement on top of v2.6.1.3 for:
	a) USSXGMII APIs are newly added for GPY24X chips.
	b) Changes to use base + offset model rather than absolute address.
	   In order to use the same API for both GPY21X and GPY24X, we adopted base + offset rather than absolute address.
	   Offset remains same for both GPY21X and GPY24X but base address changes.
	c) LED brightness control for constant level of max at 15 or user input in range 0 to 15.
	   0 to turn off the LED, 1 being the lowest brightness and 15 being highest.
	d) LED API is update to input validate the max LEDs supported on GPY24X are to 3 from that of 4 on GPY21X.
	e) PTP APIs updated to remove unwanted precision less than 1sec related calculations.
	   It is also enhanced to calculate few values like sub_sec/sub_nsec update, addend, update frequency internally
	   from given PTP clock frequency.
	f) PTP bug fixed to remove an invalid input validation check of 'MAX_SEC_IN_DAY'. It is required to initialize
	   the system time from year 1970 up to today's date given in seconds.
	g) PTP APIs are optimized by removing unwanted settings in GMAC-Lite.
	h) Added two new APIs for enable/disabling MACsec by clubbing few APIs and removing unwanted configurable options.
	i) GPY2XX init is updated to read and store HW capabilities once during init like SyncE/MACsec support etc.
	j) Force speed setting API is updated to select Master/Slave port type manually, and disable this selection
	   when ANEG is enabled.
	k) External interrupt APIs are updated to separate standard vs extended interrupts and it's status.
	l) SyncE APIs are updated to differentiate b/n GPY21X vs GPY24X and use appropriate registers dynamically.
	m) FFU APIs is inpute valideted to make sure it always uses master slice address and return error otherwise.
