== Terminology

Microchip is aware that some terminology used in this project is antiquated and
inappropriate. As a result of the complex nature of software where seemingly
simple changes have unpredictable, and often far-reaching negative results on
the software's functionality (requiring extensive retesting and revalidation) we
are unable to make the desired changes in all legacy systems without
compromising our product or our clients' products.
