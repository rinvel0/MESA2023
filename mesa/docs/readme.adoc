== README

MESA (Microchip Ethernet Switch API), is a C library supporting the Ethernet
switches and PHYs in the `vscXXXX` family.

For a gentle introduction introduction MESA (and associated components), then
read the link:#mesa/docs/introduction[Introduction] section.

If you are in a hurry, then read the link:#mesa/docs/getting-started[Getting
Started] section.

=== Audience

This material is targeting engineers integrating `vsc` switches and the
associated SW. The library is written in `C` and it is expected that the
audience is fluent in `C`.

Even though the MESA library is OS agnostic, a Linux based development
environment is assumed. The user should also be familiar with normal application
development under Linux before reading this.

== Readers guide

This is the main MESA documentation. The intension is to over time to collect all
the relevant documentation into the document.

The documentation material is a combination of release-notes, high-level
introduction documents, detailed technical documents, C-header files, code
examples and auto-generated capability information.

The header files should be considered as reference material. This is the real
header files from the source archives, only processed with color coding, and a
cross reference DB.

When reading this material, you will find extensive use of cross-references.
This is to help the reader finding the relevant C-symbols, documents and/or
examples. Every C symbol is cross-referenced, and it is easy to jump between
definitions, use of symbol and documents mention a symbol.
