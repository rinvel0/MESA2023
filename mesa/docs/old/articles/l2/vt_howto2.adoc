:vt: VLAN Translation

== Requisite

Create some {vt} entries for a translation group, e.g. a bi-directional
translation from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20 and an egress translation from VLAN 30
to VLAN 40.

== Solution

The necessary API for adding new entries to a translation group is
`mscc-sym:mesa_vlan_trans_group_add` and the container used to pass all the
relevant information down to the API is `mscc-sym:mesa_vlan_trans_grp2vlan_conf_t`.
The necessary info to be filled out is the translation group where the entry will be
added and all the translation parameters, i.e. direction, "external" VLAN and "internal"
VLAN.

NOTE: A VLAN is marked as either "internal" or "external" in regards to the switch, so
"external" is the VLAN the frame is tagged with and "internal" is the VLAN it gets
classified to while inside the switch.

Let's take the case of a bi-directional translation from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20. The following
code example is using the API to add such an entry; the direction parameter is
`MESA_VLAN_TRANS_DIR_BOTH`, the "external" VLAN `vid` is 10 and the "internal" VLAN `tvid`
is 20:

And now for a case of an egress-only translation; the direction parameter will be
`MESA_VLAN_TRANS_DIR_EGRESS`, the "external" `vid` is 40 and the "internal" VLAN `tvid`
is 30:
