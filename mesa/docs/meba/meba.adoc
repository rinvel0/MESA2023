== Introduction

The MEBA (Microchip Ethernet Board API), is a `c` library to organize and
simplify the configuration and status of the various components on the switch
reference boards.

MEBA is aiming for providing a unified set of abstractions to all the board
components except for the switch it self.

WebStaX, SMBStaX, IStaX and MESA-Demo applications uses MEBA to abstract access
to the various board components. Third-party application may or may not be used
MEBA, it is a non-mandatory option.

While the MEBA headers are common for all implementations, each implementation
is board specific (but a single implementation may support multiple boards by
doing probing).

The MESA packet provides a MEBA implementation matching the references boards,
but customers creating their own boards may need to do their own MEBA
implementation to make WebStaX/MESA-Demo run.

=== Terminology

Throughout the document the following terms are used.

MEBA API:: The "C" language application programming interface defined
by the header `<microchip/ethernet/board/api.h>`, being part of the
Microchip Switch API. This is located in the `meba/include` directory
of the Microchip Switch API source tree.

MEBA user:: An application using the MEBA API. This will typically be
the WebStaX switch application or the MESA-Demo application.

MEBA implementation:: An implementation of the MEBA API for one or
more specific hardware targets. The MEBA implementations for the
Microchip reference boards are located in the `meba/src` directory of
the Microchip Switch API source tree.

MESA:: Microchip Ethernet Switch API.

Application:: Another term for MEBA user.

== Overview

The MEBA layer is typically implemented as a library, with one single
exposed symbol `meba_initialize`.

All other MEBA functions are accessed _indirectly_ through the `meba_inst::api`
function pointers. All MEBA entry points have the MEBA instance pointer as the
first parameter.

The MEBA library can either be linked statically with the application,
or it can be loaded dynamically. The WebStaX application currently
load MEBA dynamically, and has knowledge of which MEBA library to use
for a specific board.

The MEBA layer will be executing in Linux user-space with the same
privileges as the MEBA user. It will have access to the normal Linux
usermode API's, as well as to MESA. In addition, the caller export a
number of function pointers via the `meba_board_interface_t`
structure.

The `meba_board_interface_t` structure (provided by the application
instantiating the API) defines all the needed callbacks including:

* Low-level switch register access
* I2C access (for a specific port)
* Trace output
* Configuration data access

The image below illustrates the overall system architecture. The _MEBA
Callouts_ are the function pointers offered by the application during
MEBA initialization.

== Using MEBA

To use MEBA, the application is expected to include the
`microchip/ethernet/board/api.h` header, which provides access to all the defined
MEBA symbols and types.

The initialization sequence for an application using MEBA must perform
the following steps.

. Allocate and initialize the `meba_board_interface_t` structure.

. Call `meba_initialize` with the initialized instance of
  `meba_board_interface_t`.

.. MEBA will now initialize the board, and if it succeeded it will return an
   instance of `meba_inst` for further use.

.. In case of error, it will return a `NULL` pointer.

. The handle will contain information to instantiate the MESA API. After MESA
  instantiation, both layers are operational. Specifically, the
  `meba_api_t::meba_port_entry_get()` API can be used to establish a port map
  for MESA.

. Should the application wish to perform graceful shutdown, the
 `meba_api_t::meba_deinitialize()` can be used before exiting.

After this MEBA is fully initialized. Next step is to initialize MESA, and then
the two layers are ready to be used.


== MEBA in details

This section provides mode detailed information on what the various MEBA
functions are expected to do. This is useful to know if using MEBA, but is
essential to know if updating a MEBA implementation for a new board.

=== Initialization

The function must allocate and initialize the instance structure, the callouts
are copied to the allocated instance.

The return value should convey whether the expected hardware is
present. During execution of this function the MESA layer is not (yet)
initialized and must *not* be used.

If local state is required by the board implementation, the instance
member pointer `inst.private_data` may be used to store this.

At the time of returning from this function, the `meba_inst::props`
structure must be initialized in order for the MESA API to be
instantiated. This implies initializing:

* Board name - textual representation of the target system
* Target chip (the MSCC switch 4-digit hexadecimal chip number)
* mux_mode (depending on target)

It is allowed that a specific board does not support all the features
that the MEBA API defines. As such, a MEBA API function pointer may be
set as `NULL`. This implies that the corresponding functionality is
not available on the board in question. I.e. if a board does not
support SFP's, the function pointers for SFP functions can simply be
left `NULL`. Other non-NULL MEBA API's should be hooked up in the
`meba_inst::api` in this function.

IMPORTANT: If a MEBA implementation support more than one board type,
the appropriate board must be determined before returning from this
function. This may involve direct access to chip registers via the
`meba_board_interface_t` register access functions.

=== De-initialization

The `meba_api_t::meba_deinitialize()` function must de-allocate the board
instance and any other resources. Where required, the board hardware may also be
brought to a given state.

=== Board capabilities

The `meba_api_t::meba_capability()` function is used by the application to query
board capabilities. The list of capabilities can be seen in `meba_cap_t`

IMPORTANT: This API is mandatory to implement, as it disclose required
information about the target board.

=== Board reset

The board reset function (`meba_api_t::meba_reset()`) will bring certain board
components to a well-defined state at command.

The reset points are defined in `meba_reset_point_t`.

The MEBA implementation may at its discretion perform the reset operations all
under `MEBA_BOARD_INITIALIZE`, or under the individual reset points. Its the
responsibility of the MEBA user to issue the corresponding MEBA reset before
calling MEBA functions for the associated functionality.

=== Port table

The port table entries `meba_port_entry_t` returned by
`meba_api_t::meba_port_entry_get` describe capabilities of the switch ports, as
well of how to control and access these and associated PHY's.

After the switch API has been instantiated, the switch application
will call this function to retrieve information of how to construct
the switch API port map, and to know what the physical characteristics
of the port is.

In the `meba_port_entry_t::map` structure you define how a given port is
physically connected:

`mesa_port_map_t::chip_port`:: The physical chip port for the port. -1 if not used.
`mesa_port_map_t::miim_controller`:: MII management controller
                                     (`MESA_MIIM_CONTROLLER_NONE` for SFP).
`mesa_port_map_t::miim_addr`:: If MIIM is used (see above).

==== MAC Interface

The `meba_port_entry_t::mac_if` specifies how the board expect the MAC to be
configured. See `mesa_port_interface_t` for valid values.

==== Port Capabilities

The `meba_port_entry_t::cap` value reflect the port capabilities, which is
a bitmask. See the defines followed by `MEBA_PORT_CAP_NONE`.

IMPORTANT: This API is mandatory to implement, as it disclose required
information about the target board.

=== Sensor support

The `meba_sensor_t` type enumerate the supported sensor types. Multiple
instances of a given sensor may exist. Sensor values can be read using
`meba_api_t::meba_sensor_get`.

=== SFP Support

NOTE: If the board does not support SFP's, all API's in this section can be
omitted.

The support for SFP's span the following areas.

 * Generic I2C access to a SFP on a given port
 * SFP insertion state
 * Detailed SFP status
 * Port administrative control

==== SFP I2C access

The generic I2C is implemented by the `meba_api_t::meba_sfp_i2c_xfer`.

The I2C transfer can either be handled by MESA or by calling the
`meba_board_interface_t::i2c_read` / `meba_board_interface_t::i2c_write`
functions, depending on which I2C controller the SFP is attached to.

==== SFP insertion state

SFP insertion state is returned by `meba_api_t::meba_sfp_insertion_status_get`.

The output `meba_api_t::mesa_port_list_t` parameter will contain all (SFP) ports where a SFP
has been detected.

==== SFP detailed state

SFP detailed state for a specific port is returned by the
`meba_api_t::meba_sfp_status_get()` function.

If a port does not support SFP the API should return an error code. Generally,
the API can only be expected to succeed if the port has previously signaled a
SFP being inserted. (See the previous section).

==== Port administrative control

In order to control any additional operations necessary when
enabling/disabling a port, such as controlling transmit on an SFP, or
port specific operations, the `meba_api_t::meba_port_admin_state_set` is used.

The API should should be called by the application when a port changes
administrative state (being enabled or disabled), and the MEBA
implementation should perform any operations needed to enable/disable
the physical interface beyond what is controlled by normal MESA port
control.

=== LED support

NOTE: Each of the API's in this section can be omitted on an individual basis.

MEBA supports multiple types of LEDs, these are documented in the following
sub-sections:

==== Board status LED

The `meba_api_t::meba_status_led_set` is used to control the board status LEDs.

Currently the only board LED supported is `MEBA_LED_TYPE_FRONT`. Blinking and
alternating different colors should be done by the MEBA user by calling the API
at regular intervals.

If a color is unsupported by the board, the MEBA implementation may
choose to return an error or select an alternate color.

==== Port status LED

The `meba_api_t::meba_port_led_update()` function should be called by the
application to update the port LED state. The application should either update
at regular intervals, or when it detects at change in port state.

The MEBA implementation should update the port LED according to
current state. If it supports visualizing collision counters or other
activity data, it can use the counters provided, as well as other
state data provided.

The port LED displayed may also depend on the current _port LED mode_,
if the board supports this (The `MEBA_CAP_LED_MODES` capability). The
port LED mode is controlled by the `meba_api_t::meba_led_mode_set` function.

This MEBA API should be called when management operations change the LED
mode, and the MEBA implementation should update the port LED's to
reflect current state.

WARNING: If `MEBA_CAP_LED_MODES` is zero or 1, this API should neither
be implemented nor called.

==== LED intensity control

If the board support LED intensity control (LED dimming), the
`meba_api_t::meba_led_intensity_set` function can be used to control it. The API
should only be called if the `MEBA_CAP_LED_DIM_SUPPORT` is non-zero.

The API is supposed to control all LED's capable of dimming (as a
whole). The `intensity` parameter is a percentage, ranging from 0 to
100.

=== Fan support

NOTE: If the board does not support FAN control, all API's in this
section can be omitted, and they should be assumed to be available
only is the `MEBA_CAP_FAN_SUPPORT` capability is non-zero.

==== FAN parameter retrieval

To expose the characteristics of the board FAN, the
`meba_api_t::meba_fan_param_get` function is used.

The application can use the information in `meba_fan_param_t` to spin up, and
drive the board fan according to the fan operational requirements.

==== Fan configuration retrieval

The fan is assumed to be controlled by MESA. In order to initialize the fan
controller, the MESA fan configuration must be obtained. The
`meba_api_t::meba_fan_conf_get()` function is designed to provide the MESA fan
configuration structure.

NOTE: The application can use MESA to configure and control the fan
speed. The `meba_fan_param_t` data provide guides on how the fan
should be operated. Fan speed control normally is coupled with
temperature sensor support.

=== Interrupt support

NOTE: If the board does not support interrupts, all API's in this section can be
omitted.

Interrupt support use three API's:

 * Interrupt event enable
 * Interrupt handler
 * Interrupt requester

The interrupt events are defined by the `meba_event_t`
enumeration. These values denote the *decoded* interrupts.

The interrupt events are signalled to the application by the
interrupt handler. The interrupt handler is invoked by the application
when a specific interrupt signal - `mesa_irq_t` is detected.

The interrupt requester convey to the application which interrupt
signals MEBA wants to handle (decode). It is the responsibility of the
application to configure interrupts and call the MEBA interrupt when
the OS signal the interrupt.

==== Interrupt event enable

The `meba_api_t::meba_event_enable()` function is use to enable or disable one
specific interrupt event, for example the `MEBA_EVENT_PUSH_BUTTON` event. The
event is enabled or disabled at the hardware level. If a specific event is not
supported by the particular MEBA implementation `MESA_RC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` should
be returned.

==== Interrupt handler

The `meba_api_t::meba_irq_handler` function must decode all the supported events
for a given interrupt signal as per the following steps.

. Identify all interrupt events for a given interrupt signal.
. Disable the interrupt event (source).
. Determine a possible instance number(s) (port, etc.)
. Call the event sink `signal_notifier`, signalling the interrupt
 event type and (all possible) instance numbers.
. If no interrupt sources were seen an error must be returned.

==== Interrupt requester

The `meba_api_t::meba_irq_requested` function must return `MESA_RC_OK` if the
interrupt specified by the `chip_irq` parameter is handled by the MEBA layer,
otherwise `MESA_RC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

The application can use the API (at startup) to determine which interrupt
signals should be claimed from the OS.

=== SyncE support

The support for SyncE in MEBA is at this time limited to the following functions:

* Detecting if a DPLL is present in the system and in case a DPLL is present
  also detecting the type of the DPLL.
* In the case that a DPLL is present and it is controlled via SPI, MEBA supplies
  a function for accessing the DPLL via SPI.
* Supplying the application with a graph describing the topology of the SyncE
  hardware. The SyncE board graph is read from MEBA by the application which
  then uses it for deriving how to set up muxes, dividers, DPLL references etc.

==== DPLL Detection

For the detection of the DPLL present in the system, MEBA provides the
`meba_api_t::api_synce::meba_synce_spi_if_get_dpll_type`
function:

This function is called from the synce_dpll module in the application as part of
its initialization. In some cases, the function is also used by MEBA itself to
determine which version of a board graph to return when differences exist for
different DPLLs.

If no DPLL is present, the function will return MESA_RC_ERROR.

==== DPLL SPI Interface

At present, the actual setup and control of the DPLL is done by the application.
To facilitate this MEBA provides the
`meba_api_t::api_synce::meba_synce_spi_if_spi_transfer` function for accessing
the DPLL via SPI.

NOTE: In the case of the ServalT built-in DPLL, the DPLL is controlled directly
via the Omega API as in this case the DPLL is not connected via SPI.


==== SyncE Board Graph

A board graph consists of nodes of various types (e.g. ports, muxes, dplls)
connected to each other by means of edges. See the figure below for an example
of a graph for a Serval2 Lite board:

.Serval2 lite SyncE Board Graph
[[Serval2_lite_board_graph]]
image::SyncE_board_graph_Serval2_lite.svg[align="center"]

The data types used for specifying the board graph are defined in
`microchip/ethernet/board/api/synce.h`.

The graph itself (the array synce_graph_elements_serval2_lite_board) is defined
in `meba/src/servalt/synce.c`

Basically, an edge is just a connection from an output of a source node to an
input of a destination node. All edges connecting nodes generally have the same
type (defined by the structure `meba_synce_graph_element_t` with the type member
set to `MEBA_SYNCE_GRAPH_ELEMENT_TYPE_CONNECTION`). The
`meba_synce_graph_element_t::src` and `meba_synce_graph_element_t::dst` members
specify the start and end points of the edge.

A node is characterized by the following features:

* It's type (represented by the type member of `meba_synce_terminal_t`)
* It's device ID (represented by the dev_id member of `meba_synce_terminal_t`)
* A number of input ports
* A number of output ports

All nodes irrespective of their type are represented by one or more structures
of the type `meba_synce_terminal_t` (one per input/output terminal of the node).

For each input/output port a separate `meba_synce_terminal_t` must be defined with
the idx value representing the port number. For output ports, idx is generally
the port number. For input ports, idx must have the constant
`MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT` added/OR'ed to the port number to signify that it is an
input port.

Some nodes (generally Ethernet ports or station clocks) only have a single
output port. Examples of such nodes are the nodes labeled 1 to 9 and ST in the
figure above. In the `synce.c` source file those nodes are:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
#define eth_port_0           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    0, 0)
#define eth_port_1           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    1, 0)
#define eth_port_2           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    2, 0)
#define eth_port_3           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    3, 0)
#define eth_port_4           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    4, 0)
#define eth_port_5           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    5, 0)
#define eth_port_6           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    6, 0)
#define eth_port_7           MESA_SYNCE_DEV_PORT(    7, 0)
#define station_clock_port_0 MESA_SYNCE_DEV_CLOCK_IN(9, 0)
----

Other nodes (generally DPLLs) only have inputs. An example of such a node is the
node labeled DPLL in the figure above. In the synce.c source file this
corresponds to:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
#define dpll_port_0 MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DPLL(500, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 0)
#define dpll_port_1 MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DPLL(500, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 1)
#define dpll_port_7 MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DPLL(500, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 7)
----

The remaining nodes that have both inputs and outputs are either buffers or
muxes. When more inputs and outputs exist, any input can connect to any output
of the same node. That is, the node can be considered a mux with full
connectivity. A buffer can be considered a special case of mux with only one
input and one output.

In cases where a mux has less than full connectivity, this can be modelled using
edges with the type member of `meba_synce_graph_element_t` set to
`MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_INVALID_CONNECTION`. If such an invalid connection is defined
from an input of a node to an output of the same node, the connection will be
considered invalid.

In the synce.c source two muxes are defined. The Phy mux is restricted so the
only connectivity allowed is from input 0 to output 0 and from input 1 to output
1. This is not expressed in the definition of the Phy mux itself. Rather this is
expressed in the declaration of edges (see further below). In the synce.c source
file the Phy Mux is defined as in the following:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
#define phy_mux_port_in_0  MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_PHY(300, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 0)
#define phy_mux_port_in_1  MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_PHY(300, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 1)
#define phy_mux_port_out_0 MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_PHY(300, 0)
#define phy_mux_port_out_1 MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_PHY(300, 1)
----

The switch mux that has full connectivity is defined in the synce.c source file
as follows:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
#define switch_mux_port_in_0  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 0)
#define switch_mux_port_in_1  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 1)
#define switch_mux_port_in_2  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 2)
#define switch_mux_port_in_3  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 3)
#define switch_mux_port_in_4  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 4)
#define switch_mux_port_in_5  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 5)
#define switch_mux_port_in_6  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 6)
#define switch_mux_port_in_7  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 7)
#define switch_mux_port_in_8  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 8)
#define switch_mux_port_out_0 \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, 0)
#define switch_mux_port_out_1 \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_MUX_SWITCH(400, 1)
----

The two elements labeled */2* in the board graph figure are "virtual"
buffers that do not actually exist in reality. They have been inserted
to make it possible to specify that the recovered frequency of 161.13
MHz from ports 7 and 8 should be divided by 2 to make 80.565 MHz
before reaching the input of the DPLL.

These virtual buffers are declared as follows in the synce.c file:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
#define divider_eth_port_6_in  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DIVIDER(100, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 0)
#define divider_eth_port_6_out \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DIVIDER(100, 0)
#define divider_eth_port_7_in  \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DIVIDER(200, MESA_SYNCE_DEV_INPUT | 0)
#define divider_eth_port_7_out \
    MESA_SYNCE_DEV_DIVIDER(200, 0)
----

This then leads to the board graph array:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
static const meba_synce_graph_element_t
synce_graph_elements_serval2_lite_board[] = {
    // type                     source                  destination
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_0,             phy_mux_port_in_0),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_1,             phy_mux_port_in_1),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(phy_mux_port_out_0,     switch_mux_port_in_0),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(phy_mux_port_out_1,     switch_mux_port_in_1),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_2,             switch_mux_port_in_2),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_3,             switch_mux_port_in_3),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_4,             switch_mux_port_in_4),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_5,             switch_mux_port_in_5),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_6,             divider_eth_port_6_in),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(eth_port_7,             divider_eth_port_7_in),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(divider_eth_port_6_out, switch_mux_port_in_6),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(divider_eth_port_7_out, switch_mux_port_in_7),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(switch_mux_port_out_0,  dpll_port_0),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(switch_mux_port_out_1,  dpll_port_1),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_CONNECTION(station_clock_port_0,   dpll_port_2),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_INVALID_CONNECTION(phy_mux_port_in_0, phy_mux_port_out_1),
    MESA_SYNCE_GRAPH_INVALID_CONNECTION(phy_mux_port_in_1, phy_mux_port_out_0)
};
----

The board graph array lists all the edges making up the board graph. The
information that still needs to be specified is the assignment of clocks to the
input references of the DPLL and the frequencies as specified in the graph. This
is done by means of a separate array of attributes in synce.c as follows:

[source,c++,linenums]
----
static const meba_synce_terminal_attr_t attr_serval2_lite_board[] = {
    //              device                attr-type           attr-value
    MESA_SYNCE_ATTR(dpll_port_0,          MEBA_ATTR_CLOCK_ID, 1),
    MESA_SYNCE_ATTR(dpll_port_1,          MEBA_ATTR_CLOCK_ID, 2),
    MESA_SYNCE_ATTR(dpll_port_7,          MEBA_ATTR_CLOCK_ID, 3),
    MESA_SYNCE_ATTR(switch_mux_port_in_6, MEBA_ATTR_FREQ, \
                    MEBA_SYNCE_CLOCK_FREQ_80_565MHZ),
    MESA_SYNCE_ATTR(switch_mux_port_in_7, MEBA_ATTR_FREQ, \
                    MEBA_SYNCE_CLOCK_FREQ_80_565MHZ),
    MESA_SYNCE_ATTR(eth_port_0,           MEBA_ATTR_FREQ, \

The board graph array and the attributes array are wrapped together in
`meba_synce_graph_t`.

The application can fetch a pointer to this structure by using the
`mesa_api_t::api_synce::meba_synce_graph_get()` function.


==== Advanced Example of a Board Graph

The figure below shows a more advanced example of a graph for a Jaguar2 (24
ports) board:

.Jr2 (24 ports + 4*10GB) SyncE Board Graph
[[Jaguar2_24_board_graph]]
image::SyncE_board_graph_jr2_24.svg[align="center"]

The graph (the array `synce_graph_elements_jr2_24_board`) and the associated
attributes (the array `attr_jr2_24_board` together with either `attr_defaults_dpll`
or `attr_zarlink_dpll`) are defined in `meba/src/jr2/synce.c`.

Although this graph is larger, has more muxes and more connections, it is
actually quite straight forward to understand. What does need a little bit of
explanation though are the two elements sitting between the ports 2 and 3 of the
switch mux and ports 12 and 13 of the board mux.

These two elements are frequency converters that exist on the Jr2 (24 ports)
board in order to convert the recovered clock frequencies from Ethernet ports
25-28 to 125 MHz. These frequency converters are not modelled in the board
graph. Rather a 125 MHz frequency attribute has been set on ports 25-28 although
these ports are actually delivering a 161.13 MHz recovered clock.

== Implementing MEBA

When adding MEBA support for a new board type, there are generally two
different approaches:

 * Change an existing MEBA implementation for a board resembling your
   own.

 * Add a new MEBA implementation.

It is a matter of style personal preferences whether you choose one or
the other. Normally it makes sense to modify an existing MEBA
implementation if your board only is a _little_ different. If there is
a bigger difference in features and how the board works, you will
probably be better off by having separate implementations.

If you decide to extend an existing MEBA implementation, you should
also consider whether you:

 * Abandon the original board support, i.e. just change the code to
   only support your board.

 * _Add_ support for your board by extending the code to perform different
   operations where needed. This will require the code to keep track of which
   board it is operating on. This will require the code to either be able to
   tell the boards apart by probing the hardware, or by means of configuration
   data. Examples of both can be seen in the MEBA support for the Microchip
   reference boards.

It should be noted that if you are aiming to support more than one of
your own (similar) boards, you should use the latter approach. And if
you design your boards so they are easy to tell apart, the board
probing will be simple to implement. (Notice the constraint that MESA
is _not_ available during the probing - `meba_initialize()`).

=== Adding MEBA a library

If you deciding to add a separate, new MEBA implementation file then follow the
steps below.

. Add a folder and file called `meba/src/<name>/meba.c`

. Add `<name>` to _MEBA_LIB_ in `meba/CMakeLists.txt`.

. Enable the newly added MEBA library in the CMake project. This can be done via
dependencies, by enabling the configuration options.

. Verify you can build your MEBA library.

. Extend the empty MEBA file to include the following (use one of the MEBA
  libraries for the Microchip boards as a reference):

.. A `meba_initialize_t` function, setting up target switch and the
    MEBA API function pointers below:

.. A `meba_capability_t` function. Be sure the
    `MEBA_CAP_BOARD_PORT_COUNT` value is accurate.

.. A `meba_reset_t` function, handling only the most basic
    `MEBA_BOARD_INITIALIZE` code your board needs.

.. A `meba_port_entry_get_t` function, capable of setting up at
    least some valid port entries. If your board support different
    port types, setup only the basic ones to start with.

. Ensure the _barebone_ MEBA library compiles.

. Try getting the MEBA library running on your target system. You can make use
  of the debug output function and the `T_D()` / `T_I()` etc. macros in your
  code. With WebStaX, the MEBA output is controlled by the `main.board` trace
  module level.

Once you have the basic port functions running, you can continue
adding support for the complete port map, LED's, temperature sensors,
etc. according to the capabilities of your board.

If you are implementing synce support, add a separate file for this
functional group, and setup the API group pointer.

=== Using board configuration

In some cases, it case be useful to be able to retrieve configuration
from the embodying software application to control features in
MEBA. For example your board could have a feature to use an alternate
port table layout, which are not possible to detect by probing the
board hardware.

To support this or similar feature, the `meba_board_interface_t::conf_get`
function can be used to querying configuration data. The application can then
implement access to configuration values for a specific name. The MEBA library
is free to define the naming, for example `"myname.port_cfg"`.

The Microchip MEBA implementations use `"target"` to define the target
API switch type, and `"type"` in some cases where a MEBA library
support more than one board type, but probing to distinguish them is
not feasible.

When using board configuration, it is recommended to have some sane
default values where possible, since the configuration retrieval can
fail (return failure).
