== QOS Functional Description.

QOS is short for Quality Of Service and covers a range of functionality that
determines the handling of a frame at ingress and at egress direction.

.The handling has impact on the frame on ingress:

* Give frame classified Priority.
* Give frame classified DPL (Drop Precedence Level).
* Give frame classified PCP and DEI.
* Give frame classified COSID.
* Give frame a classified DSCP (IP header) value to be used on egress.
* Policing the frame

.The handling has impact on the frame on egress:

* Discard (WRED) the frame
* Scheduling the frame
* Shaping the frame
* Give the DSCP value in the frame
* Give the PCP and DEI value in the frame

=== QOS Ingress Detailed.

The ingress frame process includes a number of classification, mapping and
policing steps. This flow is illustrated below and further explain in the
following sub-sections.

image:./qos-flow-ingress.svg[]

==== [#bookmark-pdc]#Port Default Configuration#.

Default classified Priority, DPL can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_conf_t`) per port.
Default classified PCP and DEI can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_tag_conf_t`) per port. The PCP and DEI are only relevant for frames that are
classified as untagged (`mesa_vlan_port_type_t`). Ingress frames get these
default classified values. +
 +
If MESA capability `MESA_CAP_QOS_INGRESS_MAP_CNT` is not zero it can be
configured (`mesa_qos_port_conf_t`) that all frames on this port will hit
an <<bookmark-im,Ingress map>>. This can be overruled if the frame hits a
<<bookmark-qce, QCE entry>> with action that make the frame hit an <<bookmark-im,Ingress map>>.

==== DSCP translation.

A global table translating the DSCP value of an IP frame to a classified DSCP value can
be configured (`mesa_qos_dscp_conf_t`). Per port it can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_dscp_conf_t`) if translation should happen or not.

==== [#bookmark-dpd]#DSCP to Prio/DPL mapping#.

A global table mapping the DSCP value of an IP frame to the classified Priority and DPL
can be configured (`mesa_qos_dscp_conf_t`). Per port it can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_dscp_conf_t`) if mapping should happen or not.

==== PCP/DEI to Prio/DPL mapping.

A table per port mapping the PCP and DEI in a tagged frame to classified Priority and DPL
can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_tag_conf_t`).

This mapping is not used for
an IP frame if <<bookmark-dpd,DSCP to Prio/DPL mapping>> has been configured for
this DSCP.

==== [#bookmark-qce]#QCE#.

A QCE is an entry (`mesa_qce_t`) that is added (`mesa_qce_add()`) to a list.
The QCE entry has a key (`mesa_qos_egress_map_key_t`) and an action (`mesa_qce_action_t`).
The list of QCEs is traversed from the top until an entry is found where the frame is matching the
key. The found QCE entry action offers options to change the classified priority, DPL, DSCP,
PCP, DEI etc. +
 +
If MESA capability
`MESA_CAP_QOS_INGRESS_MAP_CNT` is not zero the QCE action can make the frame hit an
<<bookmark-im,Ingress map>>.

==== [#bookmark-im]#Ingress mapping#.

If MESA capability `MESA_CAP_QOS_INGRESS_MAP_CNT` is not zero an ingress mapper (`mesa_qos_ingress_map_t`)
can be created (`mesa_qos_ingress_map_init`, `mesa_qos_ingress_map_add`).

.The QOS API offers two ways that an ingress frame can hit an ingress mapper:
* All frames on the port can hit the ingress <<bookmark-pdc,mapper>>.
* All frames hitting a QCE can hit the ingress <<bookmark-qce,mapper>>.

The ingress mapper can give frame new classified Priority, DPL, DSCP, PCP, DEI and COSID.

==== Prio/DPL to DSCP mapping.

A global table mapping classified Priority and DPL to classified DSCP can be configured
(`mesa_qos_dpl_conf_t`).

What frames are mapped in this table depends on ingress port configuration (`mesa_dscp_mode_t`) and DSCP configuration (`mesa_qos_dscp_conf_t`).

==== Priority policing.

All frames are going through a priority policer that polices frames with a specific classified priority (queue).
The policer is configured (`mesa_qos_port_queue_conf_t`) per port per priority (queue). A priority policer is reducing
the ingress information rate (either frame rate or bit rate) of a specific priority (queue).

==== Port policing.

All frames on a port are going through a Port policer configured
(`mesa_qos_port_policer_conf_t`) for that port. A port policer is
reducing the ingress information rate (either frame rate or bit rate) on the port. +
 +
If MESA capability `MESA_CAP_QOS_PORT_POLICER_EXT_TTM` is not zero then it is possible to select
between different frame attributes that should be policed.

==== Storm policing.

It is possible to configure global storm policers (`mesa_qos_conf_t`).
A storm polices can police frames depending on their destination port that can be front and/or CPU destination port.
There is a specific storm policer for Unicast, Multicast and broadcast frames that all frames
(depending on their destination port) in the switch are going through.
A policer can be configured to reduce the ingress information rate (either frame rate or bit rate).

=== QOS Egress Detailed.

==== Weighted Random Early Discard - WRED.

If MESA capability `MESA_CAP_QOS_WRED` is not zero Weighted Random Early
Detection can be configured (`mesa_wred_conf_t`). All frames goes through the
WRED that can discard frames depending on the queue filling of the classified
Priority and the classified DPL.

==== Scheduler.

The scheduler that controls the transmission of all frames from the priority
queues can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_conf_t`).

.The scheduling can be configured in two different modes:
* Strict scheduling where all queues are equally prioritized (default).
* Weighted (DWRR) scheduling where queues are prioritized after a percentual weight.

==== Priority shaper.

All frames are going through a priority shaper that shapes frames with a specific classified priority (queue).
The shaper is configured (`mesa_qos_port_queue_conf_t`) per port per priority (queue). A priority shaper is reducing
the egress bit rate of a specific priority (queue).

==== Port shaper.

All frames on a port are going through a Port shaper configured
(`mesa_qos_port_conf_t`) for that port. A shaper is reducing the
egress bit rate on the port.

==== [#bookmark-ddm]#DSCP/DPL to DSCP mapping#.

A global table mapping the classified DSCP and DPL to a mapped version of classified DSCP value can be
configured (`mesa_qos_dscp_dpl_conf_t`).

==== [#bookmark-pdm]#Prio/DPL to PCP/DEI mapping#.

Per port a table mapping the classified Priority and DPL to a mapped version of classified PCP and DEI can be
configured (`mesa_qos_port_dpl_conf_t`).

==== Port configuration.

Default PCP and DEI can be configured (`mesa_qos_port_tag_conf_t`) per port. The TAG PCP
and DEI generation mode can be configured (`mesa_tag_remark_mode_t`) per port.

.There are three ways that TAG PCP and DEI can be generated:
* Port Default PCP and DEI is used as TAG PCP and DEI.
* Classified PCP and DEI is used as TAG PCP and DEI.
* <<bookmark-pdm,Mapped>> version of classified PCP and DEI is used as TAG PCP and DEI.

The IP frame DSCP value update can be configured (`mesa_dscp_emode_t`) per port.

.There are three ways that IP frame DSCP value can be updated:
* No update of IP frame DSCP value.
* Classified DSCP used to update IP frame DSCP value.
* <<bookmark-ddm,Mapped>> version of classified DSCP used to update IP frame DSCP value.

==== Egress mapping.

If MESA capability `MESA_CAP_QOS_EGRESS_MAP_CNT` is not zero an egress mapper (`mesa_qos_egress_map_t`)
can be created (`mesa_qos_egress_map_init`, `mesa_qos_egress_map_add`).

.The QOS API offers one way that an egress frame can hit a egress mapper:
* All frames on the port can hit the egress mapper.

The egress mapper can change the TAG generation PCP and DEI values and change
the DSCP value in the frame.

==== Cut-through
If MESA capability `MESA_CAP_QOS_EGRESS_QUEUE_CUT_THROUGH` is not zero, cut-through forwarding can be
enabled per egress port and priority/queue (`mesa_qos_port_queue_conf_t`). Cut-through forwarding
requires the following:

* Cut-through is enabled for the egress port and priority.
* Frame preemption is disabled for the egress port and priority.
* The ingress port speed is not smaller than the egress port speed.
* The frame size is bigger than a device specific minimum size (148 bytes for SparX-5).
