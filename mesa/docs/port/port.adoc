== Basic Port and PHY Control
The basic port control procedure for a port depends on whether the port is connected to a 1G PHY or an SFP module:

* Initial configuration:
** If the port is connected to a 1G PHY, it must be reset and setup using the PHY driver.
** If the port is connected to an SFP module, the port may be setup with IEEE 802.3 clause 37 auto-negotiation (`mesa_port_clause_37_control_set()`).
** The port must be setup (`mesa_port_conf_set()`).
* Port polling must be done to detect link state changes (`mesa_port_status_get()`).
** If the link state changes, the operational state must be setup accordingly (`mesa_port_state_set()`).
** If the link comes up and auto-negotiation is used, the port must be setup in the negotiated mode (`mesa_port_conf_set()`).

TBD

// Items to cover:
// - How this relates to the port-to-device muxing
// - How this relates to the 'VTSS_OPT_PORT_COUNT option
//   - How does this option work when having a mix of port types
// - We need to improve the polling description
//   - What settings needs to be applied the first time mesa_port_conf_set is
//     called?
//   - In the demo application mesa_port_conf_set is also called in the poll
//     loop - I believe this is required...
//   - Is it always enough to poll mesa_port_status_get for state changes? or do
//     we need to ask the PHY for state changes?
//   - 'If the link state changes, the operational state must be setup accordingly' is this only link up/down?
// - Anything the user need to know to
//   - Add dual media support
// - How is this suppose to relate to MEBA?
// - We need to introduce more features:
//   - Different host interfaces
//   - SD??
//   - flow control
//   - aneg, and control of what speeds to advertise, duplex
//   - MTU?
//   - LED settings
//   - Link up/down interrupts
//   - MDI/MDIX
// - Does the 10G ports needs to use other functions?
//
//
// Horatiu: I believe there are lot to add here - can you try to do a brain dump
// of the important items/findings you did when writing the port module.

//- Initialize the drivers:
//To be able to use the phy_driver, you need first to initialize it. To
//initialize, the function 'driver_init' should be called. The purpose of this
//function is to set all the function pointers of the meba_phy_driver_t structure
//to all specific functions of the phy. Meba library has already integrated some
//drivers, to initialize those call the following functions on 'meba_board.so':
//    - meba_default_phy_driver_init
//    - meba_mscc_driver_init
//    - meba_maliby_driver_init
//    - meba_venice_driver_init
//All these functions can be found in:
//meba/include/microchip/ethernet/board/api/phy_driver.h
//
//The initialization of the sfp_drivers is the same as the phy_driver. The only
//difference is that there are other init functions that need to be called. Ex:
//meba/include/microchip/ethernet/board/api/sfp_driver.h
//
//It is developer responsibility to keep track of all existing drivers.
//
//- Attach phy to driver:
//Before attaching the driver to the phy, the phys need to be detected. To detect
//the phy use the function 'mesa_miim_read' to read the register 2 and 3 of the
//phy. This gives the phy id. Based on these registers you get they phy id which
//is (reg2 << 16) | reg3.
//
//Then this value needs to be match with the driver id and anded with the driver
//mask. If the results match then it means that the driver supports the phy.
//Meaning that all the changes to the HW phy needs to go through the driver.
//
//- Attach sfp to driver
//Because it needs to support pluging and removal of the sfp, then you need to
//have a thread that justs iterates all over the ports that have SFP support and
//read over i2c the content of the SFP. If reads some valid data it means that
//there is a SFP inserted. The match between the SFP module and SFP driver is made
//based on the SFP name.
//
//Because there are many names for the SFP. In case there is no exising driver for
//an SFP module, then the function 'meba_fill_driver' will read the content of the
//ROM of SFP module and try to create a SFP driver on the fly. So next time when
//the SFP is inserted it would detect the SFP.
//
//When an SFP is removed, it is possible to see in the status of the sfp port. The
//member 'los' of the struct 'meba_sf_driver_status_t' is true when SFP is
//removed. To improve the response time, the developer subscribe to meba events
//using the function 'vtss_interrupt_source_hook_set'. Then when the SFP is
//removed then a interrupt is generated.
//
//- Template structeres:
//For easy usage you can have a structure that contains 2 drivers(phy and sfp)
//which are by default nullptr, and when a driver can match a phy or sfp, the you
//just assing the driver to the member of the structure.
//
//Eg:
//struct port_instance {
//    ........
//    meba_phy_device_t *_phy;
//    meba_sfp_device_t *_sfp;
//};
//
//After the driver is attached to the device, then it is recommended to reset the
//device, using the function 'meba_XXX_driver_reset'. Which accepts as a parameter
//an interface mode. After this device can be configured using the function
//'meba_XXX_driver_conf_set'.
//
//- Port issues
//Based on the capabilities of the port(which are filled in the meba), it can
//detect if a port is RJ45, SFP or dual media.
//
//The basic flow of the port module is to read the current status of the device
//using the function 'meba_XXX_driver_poll' and then set the desired configuration
//using 'meba_XXX_driver_conf_set'.
//
//The more difficult cases is when the port has dual media support. In this case
//the port_instance should have both pointers(_phy, _sfp) set to some drivers. The
//tricky part is to know from where to read the existing status. For example:
//
//If the port is dual media but is set to use RJ45, then it needs to read the
//status from phy but if it is set to use SFP then it needs to read from SFP. Then
//if both cables are inserted at the same time it needs to know which one to use.
//To do that the port has a capability saing which one to
//prefer(VTSS_APPL_AMS_COPPER_PREFFERED, VTSS_APPL_AMS_FIBER_PREFFERED). Based on
//all this information the port_instance should figure out from where to pull the
//status. To set the configuration for this kind of ports it is similar with ports
//that are not dual media.
//And then based on all this, there is one more case where the phy  is internal
//then it needs to have a variable to store the current state of the
//port(use RJ45/SFP). And if the phy is external then it is possible to get this
//information directly from meba.
//
//Another special case of the ports DM ports that have inserted Cu-SFP modules.
//In this case the developr needs to use the interface SGMII_CISCO.
//
//In case of dual media ports, in case it is changing the media type. It needs to
//turn on or off manually the phy/fiber. For example if the port it is using RJ45
//and then the media type is change to fiber, then the following actions should be
//taken: turn off the phy, configure the mac for SFP, turn on sfp.
//
//When both ports(current port and the other end) are in auto-negatioation mode
//and if one of the ports are changing to force speed, then the other port can't
//detect that. The solution is do a shutdown/no shutdown on the port on which the
//speed was changed.
//
//The current implementation in port module is that the main threads polls the
//status of each port in each second. That can introduce some problems for
//example: a port goes down and up fast, before the thread has the possibility to
//detect that. The solution is to register again for events and when the port goes
//down. Then when the event happens to call all the listeners of the interface.
//
//- Port shutdown
//In case a port is shutdown. Then it needs first to shutdown the port and then
//the phy. Then when the port is enabled, then it needs to enable the phy and then
//the port. Otherwise it MAC will get flush timeouts.

== Port Counters
The API provides functions to read and clear counters for each port (`mesa_port_counters_t`).
