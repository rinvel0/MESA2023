== API 5.7

|===
|Version:          |API-5.7.0
|Previous Version: |API-5.6.0
|Date:             |2018-12-18
|Code Revision:    |6db15b0
|Description:      |Roadmap release
|===

=== Features/Changes

==== Mini application and PHY-only build scripts

The mini-application and the PHY-only build scripts have been moved to
phy_demo_appl/. The mini-application (in a switch context) has been replaced by
the mesa/demo application, but is still used with the PHYs in some cases.

==== L3-ECMP support added

The L3 API (l3.h/vtss_l3_api.h) has been extended with ECMP support. ECMP is
supported for IPv4 and IPv6. Max number of equal cost paths for a route is 8,
and the number of ECMP routes is limited by the ARP table. ECMP does not add any
new APIs, but relies on calling `mesa_l3_route_add` multiple times.

==== Note for MDIO external CPU users

A new flag named packet_init_disable has been added in
`mesa_init_conf_t`. It is used to disable configuration of the
DEVCPU_QS target on Luton-26.

This flag must be set if the API is used to manage a Luton-26 over MDIO.

=== Bugfixes

* Fixed:
** 10G PHYs:
*** PHYAPI-789: Malibu/Venice has slightly high offset in 1pps when tested with Calnex (paragon-x)
*** PHYAPI-790: Venice RevC/D: Loopback H2 does not work @ 1G data rate
*** PHYAPI-791: Venice/Malibu: Modifications needed in the Packet BIST configuration function
*** PHYAPI-792: 10G PHY API: Top Level Public API using VTSS_RC()
*** PHYAPI-798: Venice VSC8489: Chip reports link down on Ch0 after API load
*** PHYAPI-833: Venice-A:warm start errors are seen by performing warm start post 10G interface shutdown.

** 1588 Time-stamping:
*** PHYAPI-787: Venice/Malibu 1588  Timestamp SRC/FREQ selection issue

** 1G PHYs:
*** PHYAPI-788: 1G PHY: I2C functions do not address the entire 256-byte range
*** PHYAPI-796: Logs indicate MAC i/f Not Configured with QSGMII MAC i/f
*** PHYAPI-797: COMA Mode Control
*** PHYAPI-800: Debug function vtss_debug_info_print() does not output 1G Registers from Chip I/F Layer
*** PHYAPI-801: Viper B link not coming up after upgrading API
*** PHYAPI-840: Add 100TX Parellel Detect workaround when Pre-Emphasis is enabled

** Interrupts/events, EEE, fan control, temperature sensors, symreg.:
*** MESA-354: MIIM slave I/F deadlock on Luton26 when writing fast register

** Queue system, status, counters (includes port macro setup).:
*** MESA-404: L26 OOS fix API+APPL in 4-dev

** Y.1564:
*** AA-11452: Y.1564 issue with frame sizes higher than 1518 bytes

* Fixed but not verified:
** 10G-PHY:
*** Bugzilla#22850: Venice & Malibu I2C MAster interface: workaround for I2C Reset sequence

* Known issues:
** VSC7414/VSC7416/VSC7418:
*** Bugzilla#23680: LC-PLL re-lock process performed by the MSCC API can render the switch's register space inaccessible to an eCPU application accessing the switch via PCIe
