=== Features/Changes

==== New feature: Enhanced VLAN capabilities

The API now allows to do ingress and egress processing of zero, one or two VLAN
tags. This processing includes forwarding decisions, policing, QoS mappings and
statistics.

The actual capabilities of a given chip is advertised in the following
capabilities: `MESA_CAP_L2_XFLOW`, `MESA_CAP_L2_XSTAT` and `MESA_CAP_L2_XDLB`.

To facilitate this, the following API functions has been added:

* `mesa_ingress_cnt_alloc`/`free`/`get`/`clear`
* `mesa_dlb_policer_alloc`/`free`/`conf_get`/`conf_set`
* `mesa_iflow_alloc`/`free`/`conf_get`/`conf_set`
* `mesa_tce_init`/`add`/`del`
* `mesa_egress_cnt_alloc`/`free`/`get`/`clear`
* `mesa_eflow_alloc`/`free`/`conf_get`/`conf_set`

The ingress processing is used in conjunction with the existing vce-APIs, which
can now match on an inner tag, and optionally point to a `mesa_iflow_id_t`.

==== New features: Configurable VCE key sizes

To allow optimizing the TCAM-resources usages, it is now possible to configure
the key sizes used when installing VCE entries in the TCAM.

This configuration must be applied before any rules are installed. This is done
by specifying the `key_type` field in the `mesa_vcl_port_conf_t` structure.

Default value (structure memset to zero), is `MESA_VCAP_KEY_TYPE_NORMAL`, which
is also the rule size used in previous APIs.

==== New feature: MAC table: CPU-Copy for SMAC

This change only affects applications that require a copy of frames with a
particular SMAC to the CPU (typically for S/W-based learning):
Setting of the `mesa_mac_table_entry_t` structure's copy_to_cpu member no longer
directs frames to the CPU if they arrive on a port as source MAC. Use the
`copy_to_cpu_smac` member instead.

==== New feature: L3 Multicast Routing

To addition to the existing L3 Unicast Routing, the API now supports L3 Multicast Routing
for versions IPv4 and IPv6.
To support this, the following API functions have been added:

* `mesa_l3_mc_route_add`
* `mesa_l3_mc_route_del`
* `mesa_l3_mc_route_rleg_add`
* `mesa_l3_mc_route_rleg_del`
* `mesa_l3_mc_route_active_get`

The functionality is integrated into the same files and structures
as Unicast Routing and can be viewed in l3.h.

=== Bugfixes

* Fixed:
** Queue system, status, counters (includes port macro setup).:
*** MESA-417: Flush timeouts may occur during boot
*** MESA-421: JR2: CPU should be excluded from contributing to ingress port's back presssure
*** MESA-424: Wrong XAUI mapping when disabling/enabling lane alignment

** Scheduler mode, shaper/queue setup, mappings.:
*** MESA-426: AFI & HQoS: AFI flows can be affected while reconfiguring HQoS

** Targets, general initialization (memories, PLLs etc):
*** MESA-415: VSC7436 API init fail due to external CPU T1040 SPI read issue

** Time-of-day, latency, timestamp.:
*** MESA-414: Frequency output settings in function mesa_ts_external_io_mode_set is wrong

** VSC7513/VSC7514:
*** Bugzilla#22644: [WM]Ocelot: Frame loss observed when broadcasting is done from 4 ports without congestion

* Fixed but not verified:
** None.

* Known issues:
** VSC7414/VSC7416/VSC7418:
*** Bugzilla#23680: LC-PLL re-lock process performed by the MSCC API can render the switch's register space inaccessible to an eCPU application accessing the switch via PCIe
