=== Disclaimers

The support of SparX-5/5i (all SKUs) in this release is considered to be in BETA
quality. It can be used for early access, to evaluate the features and/or start
SW integration. It is not suitable for production use.


==== SparX-5/5i board support

Two reference boards exists: PCB134 and PCB135. These boards has different
capabilities, and also different issues. The features and the known issues with
the two boards are described below. As this is considered a BETA release, we
encourage customers to use the boards, but avoid the known issues described
below.


===== PCB134: SFP board

This board has 12x SFP+, 8x SFP28 and 1x 1G-CU PHY.

In this release, 25G support is not supported, and all the SFPs (both SFP+ and
SFP28) has a max speed of 10G.

This means that the boards can demonstrate the full 200G (actually it is 201G)
switching capabilities of VSC7558. If a lower grade SKU is used, only a subset
of the ports will be activated.

To get the best test results, optical SFPs shall be used, or DAC cables with a
length of 3 meters. Only the 10G and 1G modes are considered stable, all other
modes are still in development.


===== PCB135: CU-PHY board

This board has 4x SFP28, 4x 10G-CU, 48x 1G-CU and 1x 1G-CU.

The support of PCB135 is still in an early state, and only the 48+1 1G CU phys
are considered stable. The remaining ports has know issues, and use of these
should be avoided in this release.

If the VSC7546 SKU is used, only 24x 1G ports will be available.


=== Time Aware Scheduler (TAS / TS) APIs added

TAS API and implementation supporting SparX-5i has been added.

A TAS configuration (mainly) consists of a cycle time and a list of gate control
elements (`gce`). A given gate control element has a duration time specifying
how long it is active, and a mask specifying which queues are open. The gate
control list is repeated at every cycle time. Typically PTP is needed to
synchronize the time of all the switches in the network, to ensure that the
gates are managed synchronously in the network.

The TAS API can be found in the `tsn.h` header file, where the relevant
functions are prefixed with `mesa_qos_tas_`.

TAS was renamed to Enhancements for Scheduled Traffic (ST) before merged into
the 802.1Q-2018 standard. It goes under both names. TAS/ST was originally
developed in 802.1Qbv, which is now merged into 802.1Q-2018.


=== ACL Extended Filtering

The ACL API now supports configurable key generation for ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 frames.
This gives improved flexibility for MAC address matching for different frame types.
It also provides extended IPv4/IPv6 ACL rules. This can be used for matching
128-bit IPv6 addresses for devices supporting this.


=== ACL CPU Disable Action

An ACL action option to actively disable copying frames to CPU has been added.


=== VCL QoS Actions

The VCL action has been extended with QoS related actions. It is now possible to
assign both VLAN and QoS related actions to frames matching VCL rules.


=== TCL Priority Tagging

The TCL action now supports setting up an egress port to send priority-tagged
frames for a given classified VLAN.


=== Enhanced VLAN API implemented for SparX-5 and SparX-5i

The enhanced VLAN API is now implemented for SparX-5 and SparX-5i targets. The
API is backwards compatible with earlier chips. In SparX-5i this API is also
used to support many of the TSN features.

More information can be found in the link:#mesa/docs/l2/l2[l2] section.


=== MESA-DOC: Examples added

In this release a section with examples has been added in MESA-DOC. Read the
link:#mesa/docs/examples/introduction[introduction] section to learn more about
this.

=== MLDv2 APIs are supported on more targets

The `MESA_CAP_L2_IPV6_MC_SIP` capability has been implemented on additional
target families:

`MESA_CAP_L2_IPV6_MC_SIP`:
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_CARACAL`
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_SERVAL` (new)
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_SERVALT`
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_JAGUAR2`
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_OCELOT` (new)

This allows the application to control the destination mask based on a (vid,
sip, dip) tuple, which is required to implement MLDv2 snooping.


=== None backwards compatible changes in packet.h API

The packet.h APP has been updated with potential non-backwards compatible
changes in this release. A single feature has been added, some functionality has
been moved out of MESA and into the BSP, and some functions/types has been
deleted because they was not relevant any more and/or because the functionality
was better covered by other functions. See the detailed description in the
following sub-sections.

NOTE: The changes described here also applies to the vtss_packet_api.h header.


==== Feature added

It is now possible to configure CPU shaping at a per queue granularity. A field
called `rate` has been added to the `mesa_packet_rx_queue_conf_t` which can be
used to configure a max packet rate send to the CPU on a given queue.

==== Feature moved to BSP

MESA used to have the following 3 functions which was required to be used,
to make the packet DMA work. This design has been problematic as the actual DMA
implementation is not part of MESA, it is kept in the Linux kernel (part of the
BSP). In this release, these functions has been deleted from MESA, and instead
added to the Linux kernel which also implements the DMA function.

- `mesa_packet_dma_conf_get`
- `mesa_packet_dma_conf_set`
- `mesa_packet_dma_offset`

Application which used to call these functions shall be updated to not call
them. No further workaround is needed, as BSP takes care of the configuration.

==== Cleaning up of functionality covered by multiple functions

A number of functions has been deleted, because the functionality they provide
is better covered by other functions.

`mesa_packet_rx_frame_get`, `mesa_packet_rx_frame_get_raw` and
`mesa_packet_rx_frame_discard` has been deleted. Instead of these functions a
new functions `mesa_packet_rx_frame` has been added, which provides the same
functionality.

`mesa_packet_tx_frame_port`, `mesa_packet_tx_frame_port_vlan`, and
`mesa_packet_tx_frame_vlan` functions has been deleted, and the signature of
`mesa_packet_tx_frame` has been slightly changed.

The result is 2 clean function to do register based frame RX/TX (none-DMA frame
IO):

----
    mesa_rc mesa_packet_tx_frame(
        const mesa_inst_t           inst,
        const mesa_packet_tx_info_t *const tx_info,
        const uint8_t               *const frame,
        const uint32_t              length);

    mesa_rc mesa_packet_rx_frame(
        const mesa_inst_t     inst,
        uint8_t               *const data,
        const uint32_t        buflen,
        mesa_packet_rx_info_t *const rx_info);
----

Both functions does the IFH encoding/decoding and frame injection/extraction in
one go.


==== Cleaning up of non-implemented functionality

The stacking related functions has been deleted as stacking is not supported for
any of the chips supported by the API.

Following is the stacking related functions which has been deleted.

- `mesa_packet_tx_frame_vstax`
- `mesa_packet_vstax_frame2header`
- `mesa_packet_vstax_header2frame`

The associated types are also deleted.
