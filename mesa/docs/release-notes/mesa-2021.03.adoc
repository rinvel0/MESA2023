=== General

==== Introducing MEPA / Microchip Ethernet PHY API

This release introduces MEPA with a basic feature set. MEPA aims at providing a
common interface for the various PHY drivers. Currently, all the PHYs supported
in MESA/Unified-API is also supported by the MEPA abstraction layer, by simply
calling into the MESA/Unified-API implementation. Future PHYs will be supported
with self-contained implementations in MEPA.

Besides the single PHY-centric support in MEPA, we also offer a board layer
of abstraction in MEBA. MEBA will take care of instantiating all the PHY
instances according to the port map and provide access functions using the port
index and forward the call to the respective MEPA driver.

The MEBA layer is optional, but highly encouraged for designs using both the
Microchip Ethernet PHYs and Switches. Users only needing the PHYs for end-node
and alternative switch-fabrics should use MEPA directly.
