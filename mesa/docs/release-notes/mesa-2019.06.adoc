== MESA-2019.06

|===
|Version:          |MESA-2019.06
|Previous Version: |API-5.8.0
|Date:             |2019-06-07
|Code Revision:    |cc4d0915e
|Description:      |Roadmap release
|===

=== Change in feature-set

The following public header files (and implementation) have been removed in this
release:

* MESA-headers (in `./mesa/include/microchip/ethernet/switch/api`):
** `evc.h`
** `hqos.h`
** `hw_prot.h`
** `mpls.h`
** `oam.h`

* Unified-API headers (in `./include`):
** `vtss_evc_api.h`
** `vtss_hqos_api.h`
** `vtss_hw_prot_api.h`
** `vtss_mpls_api.h`
** `vtss_oam_api.h`

The functionality offered in `oam.h`/`vtss_oam_api.h`, has partly been replaced
by `vop.h`/`vtss_vop_api.h`. This is a new header file to facilitate
implementation of IEEE 802.1ag using the HW offload features offered by silicon.

=== IGMPv3 and MLDv2 APIs are supported on more targets

The `MESA_CAP_L2_IPV4_MC_SIP` and `MESA_CAP_L2_IPV6_MC_SIP` capabilities have been
implemented on additional target families:

`MESA_CAP_L2_IPV4_MC_SIP`:
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_CARACAL`
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_SERVAL` (new)
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_SERVALT` (new)
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_JAGUAR2` (new)
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_OCELOT` (new)

`MESA_CAP_L2_IPV6_MC_SIP`:
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_CARACAL`
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_SERVALT` (new)
* `MESA_CHIP_FAMILY_JAGUAR2` (new)

This allows the application to control the destination mask based on a (vid,
sip, dip) tuple, which is required to implement IGMPv3/MLDv2 snooping.


=== C++ code in MESA wrappers has been eliminated

The C++ code which has been used to implement the MESA wrappers has now been
converted to C. This means that MESA, MEBA and Unified-API only requires a C
compiler.

Auto-generated header files are bundled into the released API, such that users
who are not adding new API definitions do not need to re-generate such files.
This means that the dependency to the Ruby Parslet library has been eliminated
as well.

=== SparX-5/5i (VSC754*/VSC755*) SKUs added

Preliminary SparX-5/5i API targets have been defined in API, and can now be
build using the CMake building system.

These targets are completely un-tested, and are only intended as an early
preview.

The first release to support these targets is expected to be MESA-2019.09.
