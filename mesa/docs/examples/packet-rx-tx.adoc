== Packet Extraction/Injection Example

In this example, the switch is setup to redirect IGMP frames to the CPU queue 7 for manual extraction/injection.
An ingress port and an egress port must be selected, and forwarding is done by the CPU like this:

* Port Tx: If the frame is received on the ingress port, it is forwarded to the egress port.
* VLAN Tx: If the frame is received on another port, it is forwarded to all ports in VLAN 1.
