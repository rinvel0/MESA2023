== QoS Cut-through Example

The Cut-through example uses two ports:

* Ingress port is setup with PCP-based classification enabled.
* Egress port is setup with cut-through enabled for priority/queue 7.

Frames with PCP 7 received on the ingress port will be cut-through forwarded to the egress port.
