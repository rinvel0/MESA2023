== L2 VLAN Example

The VLAN example shows how to setup different port types and membership:

* Unaware port:
** Accepts all frame types.
** Ingress frames are classified to port VLAN ID.
** Egress frames will not have a tag pushed.
** Member of one VLAN.
* Access port:
** Discards VLAN-tagged frames.
** Ingress frames are classified to port VLAN ID.
** Egress frames will not have a tag pushed.
** Member of one VLAN.
* Trunk port:
** Accepts VLAN-tagged frames only.
** Ingress frames are classified to the VLAN ID in the tag.
** Egress frames will have a tag pushed.
** Member of multiple VLANs.
* Hybrid port:
** Accepts all frame types.
** Ingress untagged and priority-tagged frames are classified to the port VLAN ID.
** Ingress VLAN-tagged frames are classified to the VLAN ID in the tag.
** Egress frames will have a tag pushed if the classified VLAN ID is different from the port VLAN ID.
** Member of multiple VLANs.
