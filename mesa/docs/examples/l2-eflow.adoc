== L2 Enhanced VLAN Flow Example

The Enhanced VLAN Flow example shows how to setup multiple flows between access ports and trunk ports.
For each flow, the following setup is done:

* DLB policer.
* Ingress flow mapping to policer.
* VCE for access port matching untagged/C-tagged frames and mapping to ingress flow, classified VID, PCP and priority.
* VCE for trunk port matching C-tagged frames with classified VID and mapping to ingress flow.
* TCE for access port mapping back to untagged/C-tagged frames.
* Classified VLAN membership for access and trunk port.
