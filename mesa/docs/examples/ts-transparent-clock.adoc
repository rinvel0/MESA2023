== Time Stamping Transparent Clock example

Command 'example init transparent_clock' will configure a Transparent clock. +
One port will be ingress. One port will be egress. +
A VLAN will be created to enable forwarding from ingress port to egress port.

The parameter 'delay_mode' is the asymmetry delay mode. Either no delay, add delay or subtract delay. +
The parameter 'asymmetry' is the asymmetry delay value in nano seconds.

The SYNC frame correction field will be compensated with asymmetry delay, if selected. Good asymmetry value can be found by first do a test without asymmetry.
