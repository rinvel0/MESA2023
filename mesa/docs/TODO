  - css (needed for INFO:, NOTE: and others)
    - asciidoctor code highlight and cross-referencing of inline examples
    - document title is missing
    - need an example with a picture

- parser.rb / snipptes
    - preserve line numbers in snippets
    - delete trailing empty lines in snipets

- cross-referencing
  - between asciidoctor documents

- incremental build

- use asciidoctor macros instead of messing around with the xml/html - we looses
  line numbers, and ahve no way of producing good error messages
