Generating API documentation
=================================

The documentation for the API can be generated using Doxygen and
LaTeX, which must be installed.

To generate doxygen docmentation for PHY chips goto either 1g_phy or 10g_ph and run the "generate_doxy.bash" script.

A doxygen directory will be generated containing "HTML" and "Latex" documentation. The Latex directory will also contain a pdf file.

For further information refer to the template Doxygen configuration files
