# List all APPL-revs/configurations to run backwards compatibility checks against

# DO NEVER DELETE ENTRIES HERE!!
# Instead, if you break backwards compatibility, then comment out the check that
# can not pass any more, write a comment explaining why and mention last
# commit where a given test did pass AND add a new check that do pass!
#
# Here are the steps to create a new backwards compatibility check point:
# - Notice, this can (should) be done with MESA changes on a branch - the final
#   step is to merge the branch.
# - Make WebStaX compile with the new API build in-tree.
# - Commit changes locally, but do not push (yet).
# - In WebStaX, run the ./build/tools/internal-src-rel script.
# - In MESA, open '.cmake/backwards-compatibility-check.rb' comment out the old
#   reference, and add a new one.
# - Push MESA, and wait for Jenkins to give you green light. Go to Jenkins,
#   select the API-Promote project, and promote your new build.
# - In WebStaX, edit 'build/make/paths-api.mk' and point to your new API. Commit
#   and push.
# - If your MESA changes was on a branch, then now is time to merge your branch
#   to master - but do use the '--no-ff' flag ensure that the SHAs are not
#   changed.
