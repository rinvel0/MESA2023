/** \page AFI Automatic Frame Injector.
 *
 * The automatic frame injector allows for periodic
 * transmission of frames from within the switch core.
 *
 * The flow for setting up a frame to be periodically
 * injected is as follows for external CPUs:\n
 *
 * 1) Allocate resources for the frame using vtss_afi_alloc().
 *    This function takes a structure in which the application
 *    must specify properties, like transmissions per seconds.\n
 *
 * 2) The vtss_afi_alloc() function returns a unique ID, which
 *    must be transferred in vtss_packet_tx_info_t::afi_id of the
 *    structure that is passed to vtss_packet_tx_hdr_encode().\n
 *
 * 3) Transmit the frame with the injection header that came
 *    out of vtss_packet_tx_hdr_encode().\n
 *
 * 4) Optionally call vtss_afi_hijack() to check that the frame indeed got
 *    all the way to the AFI H/W.
 *    Calling this function is a must if you attempt to send more traffic to a
 *    port from the AFI than the port's speed allows for.
 *
 * 5) In order to cancel the frame transmission, call vtss_afi_free()
 *    with the ID returned originally by vtss_afi_alloc().\n
 *
 * 6) If the port onto which the frame is transmitted gets a link-down event,
 *    the Vitesse API will autonomously pause frame transmission.
 *    When the link comes back up, the external CPU will have to re-transmit
 *    the frame with the ID retrieved in the original call to vtss_afi_alloc(),
 *    because internally in the API, the frame is seen as paused, not cancelled.

     * [OUT]
     * On some platforms, it may not be possible to achieve
     * the requested frame rate in one single go. A work-around
     * for this is to inject the same frame with different
     * frame rates. Typically, a particular desired frame rate
     * can be obtained by transmitting the same frame a number
     * of times.
     * vtss_afi_alloc() fills in #actual_fps with the number
     * of frames that the AFI will actually send.
     * It is guaranteed that #actual_fps <= #fps, so that
     * vtss_afi_alloc() can be called repeatedly with the
     * missing frame count.
     *
     * The API supports two different allocation methods.
     * Which one is currently active depends on
     * the value of the VTSS_OPT_AFI_OPTIMIZE_FOR_TIMERS compile-
     * time flag.
     *
     * If VTSS_OPT_AFI_OPTIMIZE_FOR_TIMERS is 0 (default/legacy), the
     * AFI code attempts to use as few frame-slots as possible
     * to achieve the desired rate. This is at the expense of
     * timers.
     * Setting VTSS_OPT_AFI_CAL_TYPE to 1 causes the AFI code
     * to optimize for timers rather than frame-slots.
     * This might be a better solution, because there are much
     * more frame-slots than timers.
     * When optimizing for timers, each timer is pre-configured
     * to provide a fixed number of frames per second. In this mode
     * the application may have to call into the vtss_afi_alloc()
     * function more times than had it been in the "optimize-for-
     * frame-slots" mode.

 *
 * Two types of AFI injections are supported:
 * a) Fast injections
 *    Injection of a sequence of frames consisting of one or more frames with rates of up to several Gbps.
 *    IFG proportional to frame size are inserted between frames.
 *    This is known as Delay-Triggered Injections (DTI).
 * b) Slow injections
 *    Typically used for injecting single frames with an interval of ~3.3ms or slower.
 *    This is known as Timer-Triggered Injections (TTI).
 *
 * Fast injections are used as follows:
 * 1) Allocate resources identified by a 'fastid' using vtss_afi_fast_inj_alloc().
 * 2) Transmit frame with IFH.AFI_INJ = 1.
 * 3) Call vtss_afi_fast_inj_frm_hijack() to configure the frame for injection.
 *    Repeat steps 2-3 to configure a sequence of frames for injection.
 * 4) Call vtss_afi_fast_inj_start() to select bandwidth and start injection.
 * 5) Call vtss_afi_fast_inj_stop() to stop injection.
 *    vtss_afi_fast_inj_seq_cnt_get() can be called to check the remaining number
 *    of injections.
 *    Repeat 4-5 as desired.
 *    Note that fast injections, which are started with seq_cnt set to a
 *    non-zero value must also be stopped with vtss_afi_fast_inj_stop() before
 *    it can be started again.
 * 6) Call vtss_afi_fast_inj_free() to free allocated resources.
 *
 * Slow injections are used as follows:
 * 1) Allocate resources identified by a 'slowid' using vtss_afi_slow_inj_alloc().
 * 2) Transmit frame with IFH.AFI_INJ=1.
 * 3) Call vtss_afi_slow_inj_frm_hijack() to configure the frame for injection.
 * 4) Call vtss_afi_slow_inj_start() to start injection.
 * 5) Call vtss_afi_slow_inj_stop() to stop injection.
 *    Repeat 4-5 as desired.
 * 6) Call vtss_afi_slow_inj_free() to free allocated resources.
 *
 * During link down, all injections (slow as well as fast) are automatically stopped
 * and upon link up, injections are restarted.
 *
 * Maximum one frame (with AFI_INJ=1) can be setup at a time. I.e. another frame
 * must not be injected with AFI_INJ=1 until the previous such frame has been hijacked
 * using vtss_afi_slow_inj_frm_hijack() or vtss_afi_fast_inj_frm_hijack().
 */

// TOETBD - Jaguar2a:
// Note that if port is disabled when freeing (slow or fast), then AFI
// API must do the following:
// a) Disable all other injections on same port.
// b) Enable injections for port (FRM_OUT_MAX>0)
// c) Configure removals.
// d) Wait for removal injections to complete.
// e) Disable injections for port (FRM_OUT_MAX=0)
// f) Reenable the injections, which were disable in a).
//
// With PORT_TBL:PORT_CFG.FRM_RM_ONLY this can be done simpler for ServalT.
